\begin{abstract}
Systems engineering has developed a mature knowledge on how to design, integrate and manage complex industrial systems, whereas disciplines studying complex systems in nature or society also propose numerous tools for their understanding. Socio-technical systems, that situate at their intersection, could benefit from a higher integration between these. This position paper advocates for such integrated approaches. A bibliometric study through citation networks first illustrates the respective isolation of some of these approaches. We then produce a proof-of-concept of how the transfer of concepts from biology can be useful for the design of complex systems, in the particular case of transportation networks, using a biological network growth model to produce various optimal networks in terms of cost and efficiency. We finally discuss possible disciplinary positioning of such hybrid approaches.

% - socio-technical system at intersection of se/cs
% - different types of complexities : systems engineering / even within complex systems
% - but finally treat of the same objects ? debates of top-down/bottom-up


Socio-technical systems can be understood as the appropriation and use of technical artefacts by social agents, and lie therefore at the intersection of engineered systems and complex social systems. Urban systems are a typical illustration of such systems and of the related issues to design and manage them \cite{portugali2012complexity}.

\paragraph{Complex systems science}

\cite{chu2008criteria} recalls that several approaches to complexity do not

\cite{deffuant2015visions} actualize the metaphor of the Laplace Deamon, and develops three visions of complexity with progressive epistemological assumptions on the role of emergence.


\cite{ottino2004engineering} advocates for a stronger consideration of emerging properties in the engineering of complex systems, and claims for example that engineers and social scientists have much to exchange.


\cite{jennings2003agent} suggests that agent-based systems are an interesting alternative for the design of control systems, in particular thanks to their increased flexibility and robustness.

% complex systems for se ; our paper is in that spirit, illustrating with concrete examples
\cite{sheard2009principles}

% similar with design thinking
\cite{durantin2017disruptive} 


These issues of integrating complexities is indeed not particular to system engineering, as \cite{farmer2009economy} show that in the case of economics, policy-related benefits would be obtained by a more frequent use of agent-based approaches. 



The rest of the paper is organized as follows: we first develop a bibliometric study, in order to illustrate through the exploration of citation networks the effective separation of some branches of system engineerings and of complex systems science. We then develop a modeling case study to give a proof-of-study of how complex systems concepts, in this case from biology, can be used for the design of systems.

\section{A bibliometric insight}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Context}

Statements about disciplines, their positioning and their relations, must often be taken with caution, including ours, as they will depend on the perspective taken to enter the problem, on the information available, on possible higher contexts implying sociological issues \cite{latour1977rhetorique}. They furthermore involve issues of reflexivity if they are done by researchers in the field themselves, implying to find what Morin calls a ``meta-viewpoint'' to construct an integrated knowledge \cite{edgar1986methode}. However, a growing body of knowledge in bibliometrics, that can be understood as a \emph{quantitative epistemology} \cite{chavalarias2013phylomemetic}

\cite{waltman2010unified}

\section{A proof-of-concept: biological network generation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\subsection{Context}

How can the transfer of concepts from other disciplines can inform system design ? Contributions giving elements of answer to this question are indeed not new, and the entire field of \emph{Artificial Life}

\subsection{Network generation model}


We detail here the model of type \emph{slime mould} used to evolve a biological network, introduced by~\cite{tero2007mathematical}. The network is composed by nodes characterized by their pressure $p_i$ and by links characterized by their length $L_{ij}$, their diameter $D_{ij}$, an impedance $Z_{ij}$ and the flow traversing them $\phi_{ij}$. The topology of the network is assumed fixed, but the diameters of links can evolve in time.


The flows are characterized by a relation analogous to Ohm's law on links which writes

\[
\phi_{ij} = \frac{D_{ij}}{Z_{ij}\cdot L_{ij}} \left(p_i - p_j\right)
\]

Furthermore, the conservation of flows at each node (Kirchoff's law) imposes

\[
\sum_i \phi_{ij} = 0
\]

for all $j$ except the source and the sink, that we assume at indices $j_+$ and $j_-$, such that $\sum_i \phi_{ij_+} = I_0$ and $\sum_i \phi_{ij_-} = -I_0$ with $I_0$ initial flow parameter.

The combination of above constraints gives for all $j$

\[
\sum_i \frac{D_{ij}}{Z_{ij}\cdot L_{ij}} (p_i - p_j) = \mathbbm{1}_{j=j_+} I_0 - \mathbbm{1}_{j=j_-} I_0 
\]

what simplifies into a matrix equation, by denoting $\mathbf{Z} = \left(\frac{\frac{D_{ij}}{Z_{ij}\cdot L_{ij}}}{\sum_i \frac{D_{ij}}{Z_{ij}\cdot L_{ij}}}\right)_{ij}$, and also $\vec{k} = \frac{\mathbbm{1}_{j=j_+} I_0 - \mathbbm{1}_{j=j_-} I_0 }{\sum_i \frac{D_{ij}}{Z_{ij}\cdot L_{ij}}}$ and $\vec{p} = p_i$, what simplifies into

\[
\left(Id - \mathbf{Z}\right) \vec{p} = \vec{k}
\]

The system admits a solution when $\left(Id - \mathbf{Z}\right)$ is invertible. The space of invertible matrices being dense in $\mathcal{M}_n(\mathbb{R})$, by multilinearity of the determinant, an infinitesimal perturbation of the position of nodes allows to invert the matrix if it is indeed singular. We obtain thus the pressures $p_i$ and as a consequence the flows $\phi_{ij}$.

The evolution of the diameter $D_{ij}$ between two equilibrium stages is a function of the flow at equilibrium, through the equation


\[
D_{ij} (t+1) - D_{ij} = \delta t \left[ \frac{\phi_{ij}(t)^\gamma}{1 + \phi_{ij}(t)^\gamma} - D_{ij}(t)\right]
\]

We take to simplify $\gamma = 1.8$, following the configuration used by~\cite{tero2010rules} for the generation of a network in a real configuration. We furthermore take $\delta t = 0.05$ and $I_0 = 10$.


The generation of a network can be achieved from an initial network, until reaching a convergence criteria, for example $\sum_{ij} \Delta D_{ij} (t) < \varepsilon$ with $\varepsilon$ fixed threshold parameter. We will use this model with a criteria of a number of iterations, and proceed to an iteration to obtain final networks with a reasonable number of links.
